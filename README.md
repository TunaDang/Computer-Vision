## Exploration of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the context of image classification:

1. Build and train a baseline model
2. Build your own model to improve upon the baseline
2. Generate adversarial examples to explore potential shortcomings of CNNs

Various Tensorflow/Pytorch CNN models created over the years. Optimized classification models using regularization, momentum strategies as well as classic dropout and pooling to address overfitting. For example, created a model that classified 10,000 images of Fashion MNIST and achieved >90% accuracy. 

More recently in Spring 2024, achieved the **best performing** undergrad student model for CS 4670: Intro to Computer Vision *(optional) extra-credit assignment*. 

*Note:* the implementation file `student.py` is redacted as students cannot post their solutions publicly as this violates AI.
