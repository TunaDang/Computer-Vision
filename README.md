Various Tensorflow/Pytorch CNN models created over the years. Optimized classification models using regularization, momentum strategies as well as classic dropout and pooling to address overfitting. Examples include classified 10,000 images of Fashion MNIST and achieving >90% accuracy. More recently in Spring 2024, achieved the **best performing** undergrad student model for CS 4670: Intro to Computer Vision *(optional) extra-credit assignment*.
